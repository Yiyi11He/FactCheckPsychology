    "Please correct the following text based on the common writing mistakes listed below for assignments and theses:"
    "1. Jargon and technical terms: Using specialized language that the audience may not understand, making the writing difficult to follow and possibly alienating readers. "
    "2. Inappropriate tone: Writing in a tone that is too formal or informal, which can be off-putting for the audience."
    "3. Overgeneralization: Making sweeping statements without providing sufficient evidence or support. "
    "4. Lack of transitions: Failing to connect ideas and paragraphs smoothly, resulting in disjointed and difficult-to-follow writing. "
    "5. Passive voice: Using passive constructions excessively, making the writing less engaging and harder to understand."
    "6. Lack of concrete examples: Failing to provide real-world examples or anecdotes to help illustrate abstract concepts. "
    "7. Inadequate or unclear introductions and conclusions: Failing to provide a clear roadmap for the reader, making it difficult to understand the main points and purpose of the writing. "
    "8. Inaccurate or incomplete citations: Failing to properly credit sources or provide complete citation information, leading to plagiarism or an appearance of intellectual dishonesty. "
    "9. Wordiness: Using more words than necessary to convey a point, making the writing less concise and harder to read. "
    "10. Assuming reader knowledge: Writing as if the reader already knows the topic, leading to insufficient description of key concepts and potential confusion. "
    "11. Awkward and difficult-to-follow sentences: Crafting sentences that are hard to read or understand, often due to poor syntax or grammar. "
    "12. Poor use of punctuation: Misusing commas, semicolons, and other punctuation marks, resulting in unclear or confusing sentences. "
    "13. Long, complex sentences: Writing sentences that are overly long and convoluted, making them difficult for readers to follow. "
    "14. Circular logic: Presenting arguments that assume the conclusion is true, rather than providing adequate evidence to support the claim. "
    "15. Irrelevant details from research: Including unnecessary or unrelated information from research, which can distract from the main points and weaken the overall argument. "
    "16. Disorganized paragraphs: Failing to structure paragraphs logically, making it difficult for readers to follow the flow of ideas. "
    "17. Inconsistent tense: Shifting between past, present, and future tense within a text, which can be confusing for the reader. "
    "18. Incorrect word choice: Using words that are inappropriate or do not accurately convey the intended meaning. "
    "19. Redundancy: Repeating information or ideas unnecessarily, which can make the writing less concise and engaging. "
    "20. Misuse of homophones: Confusing words that sound alike but have different meanings, such as 'their,' 'there,' and 'they're.' "
    "21. Ambiguity: Writing in a way that is open to multiple interpretations or lacks clarity, making it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. "
    "22. Lack of balance: Providing too much detail or focus on one aspect of the topic while neglecting others, which can result in an unbalanced or biased presentation of information. "
    "23. Plagiarism: Using someone else's words, ideas, or work without proper attribution, which is a serious academic and ethical violation. "
